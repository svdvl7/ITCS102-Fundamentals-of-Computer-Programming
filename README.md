Iâ€™m passionate about film editing and animation, and I work with Adobe After Effects to bring creative ideas to life. I also enjoy sketching and expressing myself through art. Aside from that, I have a strong interest in programming because I want to explore and experience new things in the world of technology. I also love arts, music, and food, which inspire my creativity and keep me motivated to learn and grow.
